============

Python scripts for batch creation of CoreOS droplets on Digital Ocean

### Environment variables
This script requires two environment variables to be set up:

* DO_FINGERPRINT

DO_TOKEN is your Digital Ocean API access token, and DO_FINGERPRINT is the fingerprint of your preferred SSH KEY.

You can add these variables via the "export" command.
